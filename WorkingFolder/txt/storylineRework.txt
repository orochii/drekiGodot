intro
	training cave
	phamas forest
	haleko mountain pass
	end: graduation
	n.parnassus letter to syrus
	monsters' hideout
	parnassus ruins exploration
	end: raid at the academy (?)
ep1
	1:syrinx colisseum
		I guess you win and they end up stealing the key
		get Eric after beating him in the final! rival or something
	2:cyr's library of legends
		tracking the guys at the northern :) cave (idk what to call it)
	opening the path to niflheim
	end: battle against leviathan deathworm
	pursue Harvik into Niflheim
ep2
	Brenda comes along? Eric feels can't leave her behind, alone. She stays at the ship all time basically
	niflheim stuff
	get to Octavius' town, you'll meet her, she'll help you as a guide through Niflheim, ~~we could help the town with something I guess, which also gives a Octy intro dungeon sort of~~
	meet Hel, as a human, with child-like appearance
	maybe we can get a taste of the hm... dangerous Hel is, as an all-powerful being with a pure heart (?)
	beat Harvik? maybe not kill tho, but reacquire the eye of the Beast King
	Brenda gets fucked in the oceans of mana, apparently dies, mutates into uhh
	you're obligated to continue moving forward into Asgard
ep3
	
ep4
	
.owo
	I should add a Golden Saucy ;A;
	Hikari on a play, be a total failure. maybe like bunny suit and she's red and embarrassed and just stands there and hates it
	
.plotpoints
	killing monsters makes hikari mentally unstable? or at least the stronger they are
	-absorbing monsters would explain how filgjas work, I guess
	-or maybe something about them existing as mana, and being absorbed by any character in general, crystallized and being able to be junctioned and recalled
	-or both lol
	destruction of town of _ (place where Harvik comes from) by the academy
	why is niflheim/asgard relevant? they're both a bit shoehorned .-. or underutilized
	
	politics? more like... POO-litics! media manipulation, sensationalism, etc. conspirations were all along uh conspirashuns
	will someone get violent? revenge blindness and so on, and if so, who would be and against who? Odin could definitely just murder someone in cold blood though, like Harvik.
	the Skíðblaðnir saves the day at the end? attacks Lagronova on auto, helps at getting to the top of the Tower of Victory
	should a second profecy talk about the role of the races, or something/someone mention it, how they're kind of the same, each fighting for their own cause, all beings possessing their own will
		tho I guess also mention the way lilim act is usually not able to create understanding, except when it does, like with the wyvern and even Nybras (he's evil on his own accord, not because he's a lilim)
	
	you know... I kinda wish I could do... At meet with Mana, Hikari gets the option to join them. And then you get the option to either continue with Hikari or continue with whatever main team.
	this would probably mean some characters going with Hikari (should this also have its own ramifications? would Minuet join Hikari?) AND also the pain of making sprites for Taro, Mana (this I need anyway), 
	and party versions of Brenda and Nybras.

TODO (RMXP)
	"Retry" near Armored Insect, check stability (sometimes event does not work well after retry?).
		- OK so what's going on, it's that when events have the "If Lose" branch, they shouldn't run the gameover event. Instead, let the "on lose" do its thing. Don't call gameover when "on lose" is present.
	Maybe implement some sort of pseudo-RNG to help with consecutive misses.
