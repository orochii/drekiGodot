	niflheim stuff
	get to Octavius' town, you'll meet her, she'll help you as a guide through Niflheim, ~~we could help the town with something I guess, which also gives a Octy intro dungeon sort of~~

	I should add a Golden Saucy ;A;
	Hikari on a play, be a total failure. maybe like bunny suit and she's red and embarrassed and just stands there and hates it

	killing monsters makes hikari mentally unstable? or at least the stronger they are
	-absorbing monsters would explain how filgjas work, I guess
	-or maybe something about them existing as mana, and being absorbed by any character in general, crystallized and being able to be junctioned and recalled
	-or both lol
	destruction of town of _ (place where Harvik comes from) by the academy
